make an alias for shoot to connect to your favourite server eg. alias "shoot" "connect 103.10.125.91:27015; password scrimtim"
To have any of FOG's croshairs, open Scripts>Hudlayout.res and enable "1" on the desired one.
TO use the uber/krits counting mod, rename hudanimations_tf UBER COUNT.txt to hudanimations_tf.txt and hudlayout UBER COUNT.res. And add this to your autoexec
alias +uber_counter "voice_menu_1"
alias -uber_counter "voice_menu_1"
bind shift +uber_counter

Go through Hudlayout.res and enable any xhairs you want.
